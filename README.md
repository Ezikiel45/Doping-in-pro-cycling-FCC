# Doping-in-pro-cycling-FCC
A scatter plot of doping abuses in professional cycling

Using Css, html and Javascript (babel) create a scatter plot of professional cycling times and whether they were found to be doping or not. Plot should be color coded and hovering over the plot point should display a hovering information box near the mouse giving more detailed information. 

This was a project for freecodecamp.org
